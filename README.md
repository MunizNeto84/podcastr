### NLW #05

it was very rewarding to participate in this edition of nlw, i learned a lot this week about front-end, react, typescript. They really gave me the next level, I am much more motivated to continue learning and develop in this area

I want to thank rocktseat and the instructor of the react track Diego Fernandes, for this wonderful work. Congratulations
